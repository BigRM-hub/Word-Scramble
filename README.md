# Memory

## Overview
To play the memory game, player is presented with a grid of blank tiles, then players take turns “flipping” two tiles, “keeping” them if they match, and taking another turn, but they turn back over if they don't match. Play continues until all pairs are matched, and the player with the most pairs at the end wins.
